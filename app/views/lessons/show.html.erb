                                              <p>A lot of people I talk to view the Internet as both mystical and magical. Mystical, because there&#8217;s just so much stuff to learn, so many emerging technologies, and so few solid resources to help them navigate these unfamiliar waters. Magical, because &#8220;once I set up my blog, RSS feed, email newsletter, and podcast,&#8221; the story usually goes, &#8220;I&#8217;ll receive a swarm of traffic.&#8221; (Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with those terms&#8212;we&#8217;ll get there.)</p>
                                              <p>Typically the magical part comes first. And then, after a few months (sometimes hours), the whole &#8220;interactive marketing&#8221; universe starts to look pretty confusing&#8212;perhaps like a whole new world.</p>
                                              <p>Is it? Well, yes and no:</p>
                                              <p>Yes, marketing on the Web does require new skill sets, in addition to more complex modes of thinking about consumer psychology, the public sphere, collaboration, and social networks.</p>
                                              <p>No, it&#8217;s not mystical, and the best way to make a difference online is still through, as Seth Godin would say, being &#8220;remarkable&#8221;&#8212;and putting in some good old-fashioned creativity and sweat equity (and following some old-fashioned rules of relationship) into the marketing process.</p>
                                              <p>So to begin, let&#8217;s be clear:</p>
                                              <p>The Internet doesn&#8217;t &#8220;change everything,&#8221; in the sense that we can suddenly reach people just by putting up a website. That is, don&#8217;t expect that by putting up a wiki about your latest product, you&#8217;ll start harnessing the wisdom of the crowds.</p>
                                              <p>But it does &#8220;change everything,&#8221; if you know how to use it in the right way, for the right reasons, with the right people.</p>
                                              <p>What I often say to clients excited about the marketing potential of the Internet is: </p>
                                              <p>Imagine that the Internet never existed. Remember those times before it was ubiquitous&#8212;you know, when you knew you had to do stuff, like creating a competitive advantage and communicating with people, to build a successful business? Start there.</p>
                                              <p>It&#8217;s a shocking statement to many, and usually met with a combination of resistance and dismay. But I&#8217;ve found it to be absolutely true: the net is the best lever, inter-connector, and electronic communicator this world has ever seen, but it&#8217;s certainly not a replacement for ingenuity.</p>
                                              <p>Perhaps I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself, though. Let&#8217;s start from the beginning&#8230;</p>
