			<p>You've read Michael Dowd's new book, Thank God for Evolution&mdash;or perhaps you're just intrigued by ideas like sacred evolution, emergence, evolution theology, or religious naturalism. Either way, here you'll find a community of kindred spirits engaging in perhaps the most important conversation of our time: how to meaningfully interpret our best scientific understandings of life's biggest questions in ways that make sense of our world and inspire us to co-create a just and thriving future for planet Earth and as many other species as possible. Really, what could matter more?</p>
