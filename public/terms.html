The Website is a template for you to create a community of like-minded people

This Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement (the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”)
sets forth legally binding terms for your use of the Website. By using our
Website, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a &quot;<strong>Visitor</strong>&quot;
(which means that you simply browse our Website) or you are a &quot;<strong>Member</strong>&quot;
(which means that you have registered on one of our Websites as a user). If you
do not accept the terms of this Agreement, you should leave our Website and
discontinue use of the Service immediately. We may modify this Agreement from
time to time, and such modification shall be effective upon its posting on our Website.
You agree to be bound by any modification to this Agreement when you use our Website

review this Agreement regularly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>2. <u>General Registration
Requirements</u>. If you wish to become a Member, communicate with other

indicate your acceptance during the registration process. In consideration of
your use of the Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a
binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the
laws of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true,
accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the
registration form available on our Website (the &quot;<strong>Registration Data</strong>&quot;)
and (b) maintain and promptly update your Registration Data to keep it true,
accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue,
inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect
that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, ThoughtLead
reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all
current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). Use of the
Service and membership on our Website is void where prohibited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

If you believe that a child has provided information to us through the Website,
please contact us by email at support@ThoughtLead.com or by writing us at 40

<p>9. <u>Sharing of Your Information</u></p>

<p>ThoughtLead may share your personal information: (i) with third parties who

information may be disclosed to third parties: </p>

<p>We may employ other third parties to perform services or functions on our
behalf in order to improve our Websites, merchandising, marketing and
promotional efforts, communications or other services. Those third parties may
include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us
(collectively, &quot;<strong>agents</strong>&quot;). They only have access to
personal information needed to perform their functions, and they may not share
any personal information with others or use it for any other purpose than
providing or improving ThoughtLead’s services and offerings. </p>

<p>We may share certain non-personal information with third parties for
advertising, promotional and other purposes. For example, we may work with
third party advertising companies, to serve and track our ads. These third
parties may serve other cookies. Our advertising partners may use the
non-personal information they collect from our Websites, in the aggregate, to
help us better market and serve our customers. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to ThoughtLead’s Websites and does not
address the practices of third parties who may collect your personal
information. You may visit other websites, through links on our Websites, which
may collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their
own privacy policies. The information practices of those linked websites are
not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we encourage you to be very cautious before
you disclose your personal information to others. </p>

<p>In order to provide you with the information, products or services which you
have requested, we may share or transfer your personal information with our
affiliates or subsidiaries, or third party agents acting on their behalf. </p>

<p>ThoughtLead may be obligated to cooperate with various law enforcement
inquiries. ThoughtLead reserves the right to disclose or transfer personal
information and non-personal information about you and your activities on our
Websites in order to comply with a legal requirement or request from law
enforcement or other government officials, administrative agencies or third
parties as we, in our sole discretion, determine necessary or appropriate for
the administration of justice, or in connection with an investigation of fraud,
intellectual property infringements or violations of any other law, rule or
regulation, our ThoughtLead Community Terms and Conditions of Use or other
rules or policies of our Websites, the rights of third parties, or an
investigation of any other activity that may expose us or you to legal
liability, or to investigate any suspected conduct which ThoughtLead in its
sole discretion deems improper.</p>

<p>10. <u>Security</u></p>

<p>Providing a secure site is essential for your peace of mind and trust in
ThoughtLead. We have installed encryption software conforming to the Secure
Socket Layers (SSL) protocol to safeguard all of the information you send to
us. All information is stored on our servers in a secure location. It is important
for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
computer.&nbsp;If your password is compromised, notify Customer Service at once
